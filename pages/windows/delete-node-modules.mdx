# Delete single node_modules

## Install rimraf globally

```bash
npm install rimraf -g
```

## Create a .bat file fast-del.bat

```bat copy
@ECHO OFF
SET FOLDER=%1
IF [%1]==[] (
	ECHO Delete Folder: "%CD%"?
	PAUSE
	SET FOLDER="%CD%"
	CD /
)
ECHO Deleting folder %FOLDER%
rimraf %FOLDER%
```
## Next
* Open regedit and go to "HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Directory\shell\" path.
* Right-click on the "shell" folder and select New -> Key. Give it the name "Fast Delete".
* Right-click on a newly created "Fast Delete" folder, then New -> Key. Give it the name "command".
* Double-click on the default value for "command" folder and under value data enter:

```bat copy
cmd /c "cd /d %1 && fast-del.bat"
```

# Delete node_modules everywhere
## Create a .bat file fast-del.bat

```bat copy
@ECHO OFF
FOR /d /r . %%d IN (node_modules) DO @IF EXIST "%%d" fast-del.bat "%%d"
```

## Create a new folder "Delete node_module recursive" in the registry (see above steps). 
## For the value add:

```bat copy
cmd /k "cd /d %1 && fast-del-node_modules.bat"
```

/k will remain console open, /c switch closes the console. You can play with these parameters to have the desired effect.
