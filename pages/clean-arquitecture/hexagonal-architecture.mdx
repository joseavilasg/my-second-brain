## Understanding ports and adapters

These resources talk about how a port is an interface that is implemented by adapters. In the stackoverflow answer, [Romain Goussu mentions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77516174/hexagonal-architecture-ports-and-adapters-communication-between-adapters#:~:text=Port%20are%20expressing%20all%20that%20in%20domain%20terms%2C%20that%20is%2C%20using%20the%20classes%2C%20dto%2C%20objects%20that%20are%20part%20of%20the%20domain):
> Port are expressing all that in domain terms, that is, using the classes, dto, objects that are part of the domain

which coincides with the comment on the YouTube video made by [Flavius Aspra](https://www.youtube.com/@FlaviusAspra):
> A port is an interface or a collection of related interfaces. It's not necessarily just one.
>
> A port of the model can also contain classes: typically those classes for passing data into the model or reading data out of the model. Typically these are value objects and DTOs. Key point: these are part of the domain model, because the model is not allowed to depend on anything outside of itself.

This diagram explains very easily the workflow of an hexagonal arquitecture. We have two types of ports:
* **Primary**: These are ports that are called by the primary adapters and communicate with the core application.
* **Secondary**: These are ports that are called by the core application and communicate with the secondary adapters.

## My experience with Go
On my journey to understand clean architecture, onion architecture, hexagonal architecture, domain driven design, and learning the Go,
I found [this blog site](https://threedots.tech/series/modern-business-software-in-go) where [Miłosz](https://twitter.com/m1_10sz) and [Robert](https://twitter.com/roblaszczak) talked a lot about how to build modern Go applications, which is also stated in the next section.
Explicitly, I've been reading [this article](https://threedots.tech/post/introducing-clean-architecture) about how they implemented ports and adapters into a real Go project that was messy.
This was one of my first articles that I found really interesting and explicative. But looking at the code, I got really confused about how the ports and adapters were implemented. Which lead me to do all the research that I posted above.
Now I finally understand what they did. They even explained it in the article, but I didn't understand it at the time:

>You might be confused about the ports and adapters. We messed up and picked the same names for different things (even if they fit well).
>
>Our ports are Hexagonal Architecture’s Primary Adapters.
>Our adapters are Hexagonal Architecture’s Secondary Adapters.
>The idea stays the same. We find the original primary/secondary naming hard to grasp, so feel free to use what works for you. You could use gateways, entry points, interfaces, infrastructure, and so on. Just make sure it’s consistent and your team is aware what goes where.
>
>What about the original ports? Thanks to Go’s implicit interfaces, we see no value in keeping a dedicated layer of them. We keep the interfaces close to where they’re used (see below).

## Best explanation ever for Hexagonal, Onion, Clean Architecture, DDD

I find it very important to have examples of how these arquitectures are implemented in OOP, because it's a little different from other programming languages that doesn't implement OOP strictly.
This is specially important if you don't have a extensive experience with OOP. I leave this article with some Java examples:

In the [Understanding ports and adapters](#understanding-ports-and-adapters) section, the example repo is written in Java as well.
