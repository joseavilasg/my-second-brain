# Hexagonal Architecture
## Understanding ports and adapters
<LinkPreview keyObj={communicationAdapters} />

These resources talk about how a port is an interface that is implemented by adapters. In the stackoverflow answer, [Romain Goussu mentions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77516174/hexagonal-architecture-ports-and-adapters-communication-between-adapters#:~:text=Port%20are%20expressing%20all%20that%20in%20domain%20terms%2C%20that%20is%2C%20using%20the%20classes%2C%20dto%2C%20objects%20that%20are%20part%20of%20the%20domain):
> Port are expressing all that in domain terms, that is, using the classes, dto, objects that are part of the domain

which coincides with the comment on the YouTube video made by [Flavius Aspra](https://www.youtube.com/@FlaviusAspra):
> A port is an interface or a collection of related interfaces. It's not necessarily just one.
>
> A port of the model can also contain classes: typically those classes for passing data into the model or reading data out of the model. Typically these are value objects and DTOs. Key point: these are part of the domain model, because the model is not allowed to depend on anything outside of itself.

## Control flow

This diagram explains very easyly the workflow of an hexagonal arquitecture. We have two types of ports:
* **Primary**: These are ports that are called by the primary adapters and communicate with the core application.
* **Secondary**: These are ports that are called by the core application and communicate with the secondary adapters.
